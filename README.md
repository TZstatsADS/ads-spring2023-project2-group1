# Everything Good and Healthy in NYC
 Created to fulfill the requirements of project 2 for the GR5243 course  (Spring 2023 term). The project guidelines can be found [here](doc/project2_desc.md).

+ **Project title**: Everything Good and Healthy in NYC
+ **Team #1**:
	+ Safira Raharjo
	+ Namira Suniaprita
	+ Ashwathi Nair
	+ Henry
	+ Haoyu He
	+ Xueyi Zhang

+ **Project summary**: Our Shiny app provides an overview of restaurants in the 5 boroughs of New York City based on inspections by DOHMH. 

+ **Contribution statement**: Every member of the team spent time looking for meaningful data to present before we zeroed in on this one. The contribution of each member was equal with respect to deciding what visualizations would be most appropriate to convey the message we want to as well as creating the storyline of the app and presentation. We then divided the work into 3 subgroups of 2 members each. Xueyi and Ashwathi worked on the introduction tab wherein our focus was to provide our users a picture of the grades of restaurants in NYC and highlight the major problems identified through word clouds. Henry and Haoyu worked on presenting facts related to the inspections conducted. Namira and Safira worked on displaying the gist of the inspections through a map. Additionally, Safira worked on cleaning the data in global.R and optimizing the code, and Namira worked on the UI and consolidating code from different team members.
