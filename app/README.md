# Project 2: Shiny App Development
### App folder

The App directory contains the app files for the Shiny App
 - app.R contains the UI and server components for the app
 - global.R contains data cleaning and processing that is fed into app.R
 - NYC_Restaurant_a.RData is a compressed data file that is fed into the app. When deploying the shinyapp, this file is required to be in the same directory as the R script files.
